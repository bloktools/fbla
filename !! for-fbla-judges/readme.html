        <h1>Hi FBLA!</h1>
        This document will go over a brief description of our project, how to view our project, and our sources.

        <h2 id="description">What is Bluehaven?</h2>
        <p>Bluehaven is a made up city by me and my teammate to give us full creative liberty over the design. This city includes a public high school named after it and a community center located within that just built a new gym/event venue: Bluehaven Community Center Arena. It serves as a placeholder for anywhere a real venue would put its own details like pictures, descriptions, and directions. Speaking of directions, the location selected is St. Petersburg High School (since we can't invent a location in real life).

        <h2 id="howto">How to view our project</h2>
        <p>
            To view our project, it is necessary to set up a local web server in order for the local references to work. I have included a preset executable that will do all of these steps for you, but in case, for whatever reason, you can't use it, here is how to set it up yourself:

            <ol>
                <li>Install some kind of server hosting client, I would recommend <a href="https://simplewebserver.org/">Simple Web Server</a> as that is what the instructions moving forward will be based around.</li>
                <li>After you set up the program, click "New Server" in the bottom right.</li>
                <li>Set the folder path to the <code>main</code> folder. <u>It will not work if you set it to any other folder.</u></li>
                <li>Check the "Accesible on local network" box on.</li>
                <li>Click "Create Server."</li>
                <li>Now, go to the latest version of Google Chrome and go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080">127.0.0.1:8080</a> into the address bar.</li>
                <li>Click enter and you are now on the website.</li>
            </ol>
        <br>
